📈 Support Vector Regression (SVR) – Salary Prediction

📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Support Vector Regression (SVR) using Python and Scikit-Learn.

The goal is to predict salary based on position level.

The model uses:

- RBF Kernel
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)

SVR captures non-linear relationships between level and salary by fitting predictions within a defined margin while maximizing model stability.
